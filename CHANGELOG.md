# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Semi-automated job-hunt pipeline** (`apps/worker/`): a Python worker that
  scans Greenhouse / Lever / Ashby boards, scores each posting against your
  resume with a local Ollama model, auto-tailors a one-page resume for high
  scorers (Claude + `tectonic`), and notifies you on Telegram.
- **Discovered Jobs** tab in the web app: a scored, filterable queue with a
  job-description + match-analysis dialog, per-job tailored-resume download
  (`GET /api/resume/[id]`), and one-click "Mark Applied" that promotes a posting
  into a tracked application.
- `job_postings` model in the Prisma schema (deduped on `(source, external_id)`,
  advancing through a `pipeline_status` state machine).
- Repository scaffolding: MIT `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, this changelog,
  `.editorconfig`, a root `Makefile`, GitHub Actions CI, and a PR template.

### Changed
- Promoted `docker-compose.yml` to the repository root; it now orchestrates both
  the web app and the worker from one place (`docker compose up` from root).
- Moved `SETUP.md` and the pipeline design doc under `docs/`.
- Prisma datasource is now driven by `DATABASE_URL` so the same schema serves
  local dev and the directory-mounted Docker volume shared with the worker.

## [0.1.0] — initial tracker

### Added
- Next.js + Prisma + SQLite application tracker: status KPIs, searchable and
  paginated table with inline status editing and history, CSV import/export,
  and dashboards (activity heatmap, category donut, status funnel, Sankey).
- Dockerized web app with a bind-mounted database.
