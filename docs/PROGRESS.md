**Current phase:** **v1.0.0 released** (2026-07-22) — tagged on `main`, repo public
as [`drink970082/job-matchbook`](https://github.com/drink970082/job-matchbook), CI
fully green (web / worker / e2e). Feature-set complete and validated live end-to-end;
testing/CI hardened (coverage gates, integration + Playwright e2e, schema-drift and
privacy guards). **"Hardened"
means test/CI hardening, not security hardening** — accepted residuals are documented
in SPEC §11 + `SECURITY.md`; genuinely open items are below.

For *what the system currently does*, read SPEC §4 (goals), §5 (workflow), and §7
(components); for *when each piece landed*, read the [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md).

## In flight

- **Branch `feat/universality-and-onboarding` — landed, unmerged, BLOCKED on two
  operator gates (2026-07-23).** All 11 tasks of the
  [screen-backends plan](./superpowers/plans/2026-07-23-screen-backends-and-sponsorship.md)
  are implemented and reviewed; suites green (worker 578, coverage 93.27%; web 136;
  privacy + schema-drift clean) and a whole-branch review found **no correctness
  blockers**. Shipped on it: plan Stages 1-2 (screen backends — track 1), Stage 3
  (quote-grounded sponsorship — track 5), Stage 5 (screen/fit concurrency).
  **Committed but NOT shippable — plan Stage 4** (Task 9, `66dfb65`): the fit scorer
  now also extracts the three hard-requirement facts, consumed as a *fallback* only
  where the screen produced no verdict (`merge_fallback_screen` — a working backend's
  verdict still wins, so the false-positive surface does not double). It edits the
  gated `score.txt` (an appended block only; rubric and verdict definitions
  untouched), so it **does not ship until the fit-score gate passes, and is reverted
  — not shipped anyway — on a FAIL**. It was deliberately ordered last so it stays
  cleanly revertible. **Both blocking gates** — the sponsorship precision/recall
  labeled-set run and the `score_eval` re-run — are in
  [Unverified / deferred](#unverified--deferred--behavior-may-be-fine-but-nothing-proves-it-or-a-decision-is-pending).
  Nothing else on the branch depends on Stage 4.
- **Branch `fix/bodyless-guard-and-quota-flags` — landed, unmerged (2026-07-22).**
  Worker code + docs on a local branch, full suite green, not yet PR'd to `main`.
  **Shipped:** body-required guard on the board path (bodyless rows dropped + recorded
  in `feed_unresolved`); thin-JD (< 200 char) rows skip the paid fit call; operator
  flags `--fetch-only` / `--score-only` / `--score-limit N` (SPEC §7.1, CHANGELOG).
  Exercised live over the full watchlist — see the run entry (P0 item 1) for the
  intake and what it left open, then PR to `main`.
- **Run the pipeline as a daemon** — the recurring 24h scheduler
  (`python -m ats_worker.run`) remains the operator's standing launch step; passes
  are currently run by hand.
- **General-purpose pivot — Stage 2 done, Stage 3 deferred.** Broadening the product
  from a quant/SWE niche to any field. Stage 2 shipped: configurable job categories, a
  persona-neutral `personal_profile.txt.example`, and the guided `onboard-me` skill
  (CHANGELOG). **Stage 3, non-tech discovery feeds — deferred:** the watchlist already
  covers any company, so decide the need before building (brittle, anti-bot handling,
  dilutes the moat).
  **Standing design rule:** generality lives in `personal_profile.txt`, *not* in the
  fit-scoring prompt. Scorer-prompt edits have destabilized verdicts before, which is
  why every `score.txt` change is gated behind `score_eval` — including the additive
  Stage 4 block now sitting unmerged (SPEC §7.1).
- **Provider choice + universal onboarding — 4 of 5 tracks done.** Design:
  [notes](./superpowers/specs/2026-07-22-provider-choice-and-onboarding-notes.md) →
  [design](./superpowers/specs/2026-07-23-screen-backends-and-sponsorship-design.md) →
  [11-task plan](./superpowers/plans/2026-07-23-screen-backends-and-sponsorship.md).
  It closed two premises that locked out every user but the author: the screen ran
  *only* on host Ollama, and nothing installed worker deps, created the DB, or
  reported what was missing. **Shipped 2026-07-23** — screen backends (track 1),
  universality fixes (track 2), `onboard-me` Step 0 (track 3) and the sponsorship
  rework (track 5), plus screen/fit concurrency: all on the branch above, all
  documented in SPEC §7.1/§9/§11 + CHANGELOG.
  **Still open — track 4, agent portability** — `[S · independent, pick any time]`.
  `SKILL.md` is a cross-agent standard but the *paths* differ: Claude Code reads
  `.claude/skills/`, Codex reads `.agents/skills/`, so both skills are invisible to
  every agent but Claude Code. Move to `.agents/skills/`, symlink `.claude/skills`,
  add a root `AGENTS.md` (a Linux Foundation standard read by 30+ agents; the repo
  has none). **Settle first:** whether Claude Code discovers skills *through* a
  symlinked `.claude/skills` is unverified — if it doesn't, the symlink half of the
  plan is wrong.

## Open work

Surfaced from the code and history — observations, not a roadmap. **Two axes:**
*severity* sets the bucket (a shipped defect that loses prepared work ≠ an unbuilt
nice-to-have), and within each bucket items run **easiest → hardest** with an effort tag —
**XS** (~an hour) · **S** (~an afternoon) · **M** (~a day + a design call) · **L**
(multi-day / new dependency / architectural). Blocked items name their blocker.

### Do next — the pick order

The buckets below are a *catalogue* sorted by severity. This is the **queue**: what to
take first and why. Each numbered item is independently pickable.

**P0 — the first run against the 172-board watchlist.** The body-required guard shipped
2026-07-22 (CHANGELOG), which was the blocker: every empty-list-endpoint board now
yields nothing instead of poisoning the DB with permanent title-only rows.

1. **Run the pipeline** — `[S · FETCH DONE 2026-07-22 (full, clean); scoring in bounded
   batches]`. A `--fetch-only` pass (unbuffered log) completed cleanly (exit 0) over the
   full 172-board watchlist with `enable_browser_sources: true` — the coverage question
   is answered. Intake: **7,746 postings total, 4,035 `new`** across all **11** sources
   (custom 1,411 · greenhouse 704 · browser 662 · workday 588 · phenom 238 · ashby 178 ·
   icims 155 · smartrecruiters 69 · workable 18 · lever 11 · pinpoint 1). Only **one board
   failed**: `phenom/careers.qualcomm.com` 429-rate-limited at deep pagination
   (start=930), isolated, rest continued. **Body guard fired live and held:** dropped
   citadelsecurities 7 · citadel 3 · **MSCI icims 43** (a *new* empty-JD board — see
   below) — and **0** bodyless rows reached `new`. **Scoring** is now bounded, not blind:
   `--score-limit N` caps the paid scorer and thin JDs (< 200 chars) skip it entirely
   (CHANGELOG). First bounded batch (`--score-only --score-limit 50`) ran 2026-07-22:
   50 rows → 9 screen-discarded, 41 fit-scored (**41 Codex messages, ~2% of the weekly
   budget**; 0 thin-JD skips — these all had full JDs), **4 match/match → notified**
   (Akuna x2, DRW, HRT — all on-target; DRW notified at score 58, confirming the
   verdict, not the number, gates notify). **Left open:** ~3,985 rows still `new` —
   scoring at scale is an operator call; the recipe-sourced scored path is still
   unexercised (entry below); and `custom` is ~a third of the intake, a `title_filter`
   tightening question rather than a fetch bug.

**P1 — unblock the branch merge.** Both gates below are cheap relative to what they
unblock; neither has run.

2. **Fit-score gate re-run** — `[S · ~69 Codex messages per run, two runs · MERGE
   BLOCKER]`. One re-run gates **two** changes: the 2026-07-22 profile edit *and*
   plan Stage 4's `score.txt` block (`66dfb65`). Two consecutive PASS or
   `git revert 66dfb65`; until then `feat/universality-and-onboarding` does not merge.
   Do it *after* (1) so any newly-ingested Java quant-dev row can close the golden
   set's documented Java blind spot in the same pass.
3. **Sponsorship precision/recall labeled set** — `[M · MERGE BLOCKER · free on the
   default ollama backend]`. Run `tools/sponsor_diff.py` over the already-scored
   rows, hand-label the disagreements, record the numbers. The rework is shipped and
   its hallucination-safety holds by construction; what is unmeasured is precision —
   specifically the misclassification residual.

**P2 — the last provider-choice track.**

4. **Track 4, agent portability** — `[S · independent]`. Move the skills to
   `.agents/skills/`, symlink `.claude/skills`, add a root `AGENTS.md` — settle the
   symlink-discovery question first (see [In flight](#in-flight)).

**P3 — coverage and cost, in value-per-effort order.** `browser` `{field}` templates
(`[S]`, unblocks 2 boards) → `custom` HTML mode (`[M]`, drops 6 boards off Chromium and
unblocks Citi/Barclays) → workday prose-date parser (`[S]`, cuts the remaining 6,703
detail calls) → bulk watchlist skill (`[M]`).

**P4 — everything else below.** SSRF residuals, the `@@unique` migration, schema
migration path, deployment/monitoring, dead-link sweep, more adapters, README
screenshot, eval iteration 2. Real, none of it blocking, none of it cheap.

### Defects — shipped behavior that is wrong (should fix)

None open. The sponsorship-gate defect that lived here shipped its fix 2026-07-23;
what remains is measuring it, tracked under
[Unverified / deferred](#unverified--deferred--behavior-may-be-fine-but-nothing-proves-it-or-a-decision-is-pending).

### Unverified / deferred — behavior may be fine, but nothing proves it, or a decision is pending

- **Citadel's JD is unreachable behind Cloudflare — both rows kept anyway** —
  `[decided 2026-07-22 · do not re-derive]`. `browser/citadel.com` and
  `browser/citadelsecurities.com` scrape their listing pages fine (10 postings each,
  clean on id/title/location/url) but **0/10 on `description`**: Cloudflare clears once
  for the listing render, then re-challenges the deep-link detail navigations.
  Three probes settled it — plain-HTTP listing GET → `403`; deep-link `goto` + 15s
  dwell → `Just a moment...`; **clicking** the card from the already-cleared listing
  (user gesture + same-origin referer) + 30s dwell → byte-identical. The detail route
  is challenged regardless of arrival path and does not self-clear; everything past
  this rung is a stealth plugin / real browser profile / residential proxy — detection
  evasion plus a new dependency, out of scope here.
  **Decision: keep both rows.** Since the body-required guard shipped they simply yield
  nothing (dropped at `run_fetch`, logged), costing a few Chromium renders per cycle,
  and they self-heal if Citadel's Cloudflare behavior relaxes. The only other honest
  option is deleting them; dropping the `detail:` block to take title-only is now a
  no-op, since the guard would drop those rows anyway.
- **Stale-mount recovery — sidecar half PROVEN 2026-07-22, detection half still
  unobserved** — `[S · needs a real event]`. A live drill with a throwaway container
  (`--label autoheal=true`, always-failing healthcheck) confirmed the recovery leg
  end-to-end: unhealthy at ~17s, `autoheal` logged *"found to be unhealthy - Restarting
  container now"* and restarted it ~31s after start. So label + Docker socket + poll
  interval all work; combined with `health.test.ts` (200/503 logic) the only unproven
  link is **detection** — that a real WSL2 stale mount actually makes Prisma's probe
  fail. That half is not simulable: a `chmod 000` drill on the live DB left
  `/api/health` at **200 for 5 minutes**, because Prisma holds an open fd and POSIX
  checks permissions at `open()`, not on reads through an existing descriptor. So
  `chmod` is not a valid proxy, and any failure mode that spares open fds would slip
  past the probe; the observed real symptom is `SQLITE_CANTOPEN` (an *open* failure),
  which would trip it. Needs a real suspend/resume event to confirm. (SPEC §6.)
- **`onboard-me` Step 0 — shipped, but its eval was never executed** — `[S]`. The
  skill now opens with `make setup` + `make doctor` and reads doctor's status lines to
  pick the provider path. Its *factual* claims were verified against shipped code (all
  9 doctor row labels match live output), but the new eval scenario
  (`fresh-checkout-no-telegram-remote-ollama`, evals.json id 4) is **written and never
  run** — the harness is subagent-driven. So the *behavioral* assertion, that an agent
  actually leads with Step 0, is unproven.
- **The recipe-sourced `custom`/`browser` SCORED path is still unexercised** — `[S]`.
  The 2026-07-22 full fetch proved both executors work through `run_fetch` (custom
  1,411 `new`, browser 662 — CHANGELOG). But the one bounded `--score-only` batch hit
  the oldest ids, which were the original greenhouse+phenom config boards, so no
  recipe-sourced row has ever been screened, fit-scored or notified. Closing it needs a
  score run that reaches `custom`/`browser` ids — a larger `--score-limit`, or a
  source-filtered slice.
- **Empty-JD boards ON the watchlist — MSCI icims** — `[XS · found 2026-07-22]`. The
  full fetch pass dropped **43 bodyless postings** from `icims/globalcareers-msci`: its
  iCIMS list endpoint carries titles but no description. Same property as the Uber/Netflix
  tier below, except this one is already on the watchlist. Non-destructive now (the guard
  drops them; the next run will also record them in `feed_unresolved`), but it produces
  nothing, so it is a candidate to drop or to route through a detail-fetch once one
  exists. `citadelsecurities`/`citadel` (browser) are the same story (dropped 7 + 3).
- **Boards deliberately held off the watchlist** — `[XS · decision recorded]`. Nine
  boards were validated but NOT added, for two reasons that are properties of the
  board, not bugs. (1) *Empty JD*: Uber (277 postings), Netflix (463), Morgan Stanley
  (1,350), Brevan Howard (13), Campbell (1) — their list endpoints carry no
  description. Since the body-required guard shipped these are no longer *dangerous*
  to add (they would insert nothing), but they still produce nothing, so adding them
  only buys fetch cost until `custom` gains a chained detail call.
  (2) *Render cost*: Citi (3,567 postings), Barclays
  (1,074), Bloomberg (490), Moody's (249) — a `browser` `detail:` block costs one
  Chromium render per posting with no stub gate (`browser.py:159`), all of it before
  screening. Uber/Netflix/Morgan Stanley become viable if `custom` gains a
  chained detail call; Citi/Barclays if `custom` gains an HTML mode (both above).
- **Fit-score gate not re-run — now gates TWO changes, and blocks a merge** — `[S ·
  ~69 Codex messages per run, two runs · deferred by operator]`. One `score_eval`
  re-run discharges both pending scorer changes:
  1. the 2026-07-22 `personal_profile.txt` edit (detail below), and
  2. **plan Stage 4** (Task 9, `66dfb65` on `feat/universality-and-onboarding`) — the
     appended `score.txt` extraction block feeding `merge_fallback_screen`. The block
     is additive and instructs the model not to let it change the score or the
     verdicts, and the rubric/verdict definitions are untouched — but it is still a
     `score.txt` edit, and this file has destabilised verdicts before.

  **Gate:** two *consecutive* PASS — 0 hard-invariant violations, >=85% per-dimension
  verdict agreement, <20% flip rate. **On any FAIL, `git revert 66dfb65`** — Stage 4
  is dropped, not shipped anyway; Stages 1-3 and 5 are unaffected either way. Until
  this runs, `feat/universality-and-onboarding` should not merge (see
  [In flight](#in-flight)). Run the free hermetic `python3 tools/score_eval.py
  --selftest` first.

  On the profile edit specifically: `personal_profile.txt` changed on two
  lines: target #1 widened from "buy-side or prop" to "buy-side / prop / HFT /
  market-making / hedge fund", and the anti-target moved from "Low-latency / HFT / C++
  systems engineering" to "Low-latency systems engineering, in any language, and
  C++/Java systems-level roles where the deliverable is the engine itself rather than
  the research and trading tooling built on it". The point of both edits is that the
  anti-target is a **role**, not an **employer** — an HFT firm is a target-#1 employer;
  the latency seat inside it is not.

  The scorer reads this file verbatim as the domain verdict's target-fit rule, so the
  wording is load-bearing (a past prompt tweak destabilised verdicts where a profile
  edit fixed them). `tools/score_eval.py` has NOT been re-run against the 23-row
  golden set; shipping a profile change wants two consecutive PASS.

  Two specific things to check when it runs. (1) All 23 golden labels were reviewed by
  hand on 2026-07-22 and none rests on the old firm-vs-role conflation — 813 is a
  floor-trader seat, 222 IT/desktop, 824 infra-platform, 592 hardware, 64/125/83
  research/analyst — so no relabelling is expected, and a flip would be a real signal.
  (2) **Blind spot: no golden row is a Java posting**, so the gate cannot detect
  over-rejection of Java-based quant-dev seats at banks (Goldman, Morgan Stanley,
  BlackRock Aladdin, CME, Nasdaq) — exactly the tier-2 employers the watchlist just
  expanded into. Adding one such row to the golden set would close it.

  Note `tools/score_eval.py` has no argparse: any unrecognised flag (`--help`) starts a
  LIVE, quota-spending run. `--selftest` is the free hermetic path.
- **`score_workers` defaults to 4 for every fit backend — codex rollout cleanup
  regresses under it** — `[XS · decision pending]`. Plan Stage 5 made the fit loop
  concurrent (quota-neutral: N parallel `codex exec` calls spend the same messages as
  N serial ones). But the codex quota capture reads its figures from the session
  *rollout*, and its cleanup deletes that rollout **only when exactly one new rollout
  exists** — a deliberate guard against nuking a concurrent session's history. At 4
  workers two or more rollouts always co-occur, so the delete never fires and
  `~/.codex/sessions` accumulates. Telemetry itself stays correct (the snapshot write
  is atomic and its temp file is per-call unique, so concurrent captures cannot tear
  it); only the cleanup degrades. **Decision:** leave it (documented-safe, litter only)
  or default the codex/`claude-code` fit path to 1 worker. Screen concurrency already
  defaults to 1 for `ollama` for an unrelated reason (a single GPU serialises anyway).
- **SSRF residual shapes** — `[M]`. Three shapes remain reachable (browser-path
  redirect GET · DNS-rebinding · statically-internal hostnames — accepted meanwhile,
  SPEC §11). Closing the DNS shapes needs a resolve-then-check with a TOCTOU-safe
  connect; closing the browser-path GET needs an intercept-before-connect mechanism
  Playwright's routing API doesn't expose for navigations.
- **`applications` has no DB `@@unique(company_name, job_title)`** — `[M · deferred ·
  deliberate; waits on operator]`. Three transactional app-code paths hold the dedupe
  invariant (`addApplication`, `markJobApplied`, `importApplicationsCSV`). The hard
  constraint needs a backup + dedupe migration first — the real table may hold
  legitimate duplicate rows (re-applications), so `prisma db push` can't build the
  index without `--accept-data-loss`. Deferral operator-confirmed 2026-07-19.
- **No schema migration path** — `[L]`. `prisma db push` keeps no migration history,
  so a *destructive* change (drop/rename a column) has no backfill or rollback and
  can lose retained `applications` / `status_history` data. Back up
  `db/applications.db` before schema changes. (SPEC §8.)
- **Sponsorship gate — shipped 2026-07-23, precision/recall never measured** —
  `[M · MERGE BLOCKER · needs a labeled set]`. The quote-grounded rework is in the
  code and described in SPEC §7.1 + CHANGELOG (it replaced a closed 12-phrase
  substring list that caught only ~2 of 11 realistic phrasings). What is *unproven* is
  its precision.
  **Safe by construction, so not at risk here:** hallucination. A quote absent from
  the JD fails `_quote_in` verification and the posting is kept, so an invented
  sentence cannot disqualify anything — this holds on `qwen3.5:4b` too, so **D1**
  needs no re-litigating.
  **The actual residual:** *misclassification* — the model quoting real-but-irrelevant
  JD text and reading it as a no-sponsorship statement. Quote-grounding cannot close
  this, which is exactly what the labeled set is for.
  **Open operator gate:** run `tools/sponsor_diff.py` over the ~600 already-scored
  rows — it diffs the new check against the old phrase list so only the
  *disagreements* need hand-labeling (*no-sponsorship / offers / silent*), not the
  full set. That run has not happened.

### Enhancements — not built, optional

- **Bulk watchlist onboarding as a skill** — `[M · proposed, not built]`. The
  2026-07-22 expansion (49 → 172 boards) ran an ad-hoc pipeline worth encoding:
  read `personal_profile.txt` → parallel company research per target tier → **verify
  every slug independently of the agent that proposed it** → estimate per-board fetch
  cost → gated bulk insert. It is NOT a phase of `onboard-me`: that skill configures
  the *candidate*, and this one consumes its output to find *companies*, so the natural
  shape is a separate skill `onboard-me` recommends as a closing step. Four things the
  run proved are load-bearing: (a) research and verification must be separate passes —
  five agent "verified" claims failed re-running (Workday-needs-a-browser, Wintermute
  bot-blocked, Nasdaq's site name, FactSet's datacenter, Geode SOLVED-but-returns-0);
  (b) squatted slugs are the real hazard — greenhouse `proof` serves a live 216-job
  board belonging to a different company, which poisons the feed more quietly than a
  failure; (c) cost must be estimated *before* insert (a row cheap to add can cost
  3,567 renders to run); (d) the empty-JD check above. `onboard-board` handles one
  board well; nothing handles a hundred.
- **Workday stub gate cannot use `max_age_days`** — `[S · needs a prose-date parser]`.
  The `drop`-only gate shipped 2026-07-22 cut workday detail calls 14,902 → 6,703
  (-55%) on the 28-board watchlist, but only via `title_filter`/`title_exclude`. The
  list stub's sole date is prose (`"Posted 30+ Days Ago"`, `"Posted Today"`), so
  `parse_stub` sets `posted_at: None` and the age filter errs toward keeping. Parsing
  that string would drop much of the remaining 6,703 on stale boards. Deferred because
  the wording is locale- and tenant-dependent and a mis-parse silently drops good
  postings — the failure mode the null-keeps-it default exists to avoid.
- **`browser` recipes have no `{field}` URL template** — `[S]`. `custom` recipes
  interpolate `{dotted.field}` into `url`; `browser` recipes cannot, so a board whose
  cards carry no `href` (the id is in a `data-*` attribute and routing is JS-side) can
  only produce a broken or empty `job_url`. This is the *sole* blocker for Balyasny
  (`data-id="…_REQ8036"` → `/s/details?jobReq={data-id}`) and Jacobs Levy (5 roles,
  one static page, apply-by-email). Closing it in `_recipe.apply_css_fields` unblocks
  both without touching an adapter.
- **`custom` has no HTML/CSS mode** — `[M]`. Bloomberg, Two Sigma, Citi, Barclays,
  Moody's and Geode are all plain-`requests`-fetchable with no bot wall, yet each is
  forced to rung 3 (`browser` + headless Chromium) purely because `custom` only parses
  JSON / `__NEXT_DATA__`. An `html` mode reusing the browser executor's CSS extractor
  would drop all six to plain HTTP. Related: a `browser` `detail:` block costs **one
  Chromium render per posting** with no stub gate (`browser.py:159`), which is why
  Citi (3,567 postings) and Barclays (1,074) are not on the watchlist.
- **Boards blocked on an executor primitive, not an adapter** — `[L]`. Meta needs a
  fetch-page-then-POST handshake (its GraphQL requires a per-session `lsd` CSRF token
  scraped from the HTML) *and* a scroll hook (the rendered DOM holds 11 of 692 cards
  in a virtualized inner scroller with no URL pagination). Balyasny's Salesforce Aura
  endpoint needs an `aura.context` `fwuid` hash that rotates every release. Recorded
  so the next attempt starts from the known blocker rather than re-deriving it.
- **Discovered Jobs README screenshot** — `[XS]`. The prose is now expanded to Track
  parity (bucket triage, the per-row "why" subline, the fit-assessment modal, bulk
  actions). Still missing: an inline screenshot of the tab to match the "Track"
  images. Needs a seeded throwaway DB (never the real `db/applications.db` — see the
  privacy note in §11/CHANGELOG on the existing screenshots) and a richer fixture than
  the e2e seed, which only populates the Matched + Discarded buckets.
- **Dead-link sweep — board sources uncovered** — `[M · needs a per-board signal]`.
  `run_expire` (shipped) only re-checks **detail sources**, the ones with a per-job
  endpoint. A posting from a board source (greenhouse/lever/ashby/…) goes dead
  silently. Closing it means diffing each board's current listing against the
  ingested rows — a different mechanism, and a *fetch failure* must never be read as
  "the whole board's jobs closed".
- **`onboard-board` skill — eval iteration 2** — `[M · optional]`. Re-run the
  skill-creator eval loop on the add-or-fail flow (with-skill agents add to a
  *throwaway* DB via `--db`) with tougher/undocumented boards — iteration 1 hit 100%
  pass on both configs, so it measured speed (−42% time / −18% tokens), not
  correctness.
- **More board adapters** — `[M · pick a target]`. The adapter pattern
  (`fetch/<source>.py` + `ADAPTERS`/`VALID_SOURCES`, or `fetch_one` in
  `DETAIL_SOURCES`) makes new sources cheap. Leads: LinkedIn's public `jobs-guest`
  endpoint (unauthenticated, zero-dep; personal-use / ToS caveat, keep volume low);
  JobSpy as a possible fallback aggregator.
- **Remaining feed coverage (the `feed_unresolved` long tail)** — `[M · needs
  iCIMS/ByteDance feed routers]`. Resolution sits at ~78% after tier 1. What's left
  is iCIMS + ByteDance — both plain HTTP (iCIMS ships as a list adapter, TikTok as a
  `custom` recipe), but closing the *feed* tail still needs a `resolve_url` host
  router + a per-listing `fetch_one`, which the list adapters don't provide.
  **Dropped:** greenhouse embed-token (job id only, no board slug); SuccessFactors
  (absent from feed).
- **Deployment / monitoring** — `[L · open-ended]`. `ats-web` has a DB-reachability
  healthcheck + `autoheal` (SPEC §6), but there's no metrics/alerting beyond the
  per-job Telegram notification, and the **worker** has no healthcheck — its failures
  show only in the DB/logs. Includes the deferred scraper **canary self-tests** and
  proactive Telegram/banner alerting for silently-broken scrapers (SPEC §9 points
  here).
- **AI fetch+score fallback for unparseable JDs** — `[L · optional]`. Where text
  extraction fails (JS-rendered / bot-walled / odd markup), let the scorer's model
  fetch the job page and score fit directly from the raw page, bypassing
  parse-then-score. Candidate landing spot for the iCIMS/ByteDance tail if a plain
  fetch isn't enough.

#### Architecture / maintainability

- **Cross-service drift — partially guarded** — `[M]`. `test_source_enums_sync.py`
  guards the cheaply-comparable duplicated items (source enums + the low-context
  length literal). **Still unguarded (deliberate scope call — fragile, low value):**
  the `pipeline_status` string literals (scattered across worker + web) and the full
  notify / matched verdict-predicate SQL (`db.py` vs `actions.ts`) — these stay
  documented-not-guarded, hand-duplicated with "must match" comments only.
- **`requirements-dev.txt` duplicates base pins** — accepted (no include mechanism
  exists without adding tooling), but the duplication bit once — see the
  [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md) geonamescache CI fix. **Standing rule:** any new
  module-load or test-exercised runtime import MUST be mirrored into
  `requirements-dev.txt` in the same commit that adds it to `requirements.txt`.

## How to update

This file tracks only *movement*; it should never accumulate a wall of finished
items. When state changes:

- **Starting work** → add an in-flight line under [In flight](#in-flight).
- **Closing a gap / shipping a feature** → remove its line here, add a
  [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) entry (history), and update the matching section
  of [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md) (the capability map / behavior) — **all in the same
  commit**.
- **Discovering a new gap** → add it to [Open work](#open-work) in the right severity
  bucket, placed **easiest-first** with an effort tag (`[XS/S/M/L · blocker]`). Keep
  severity honest: defects (broken) above unverified properties above enhancements
  (optional).
